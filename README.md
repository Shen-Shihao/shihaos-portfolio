This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU!

## About me
* Hello! I am a student from Global-MISM. I was majored in Telecommunication Engineering when I was a undergraduate. However, I was interested in data analyse when I was a junior since I took a course about data. And it is fortunate that I enrolled in this course!
* I'm 25 years old and I am a Spurs fan! I really like playing basketball although I'm not good at it, especially in the United States.

## What I hope to learn
* I hope to learn some useful tools to do data visualization, such as Tableau. I used Tableau in data mining last semester, but there are still many functions I didn't grasp yet.
* I would like to learn some ways to gather data as well. Analysing is one thing, collecting is another. Most assignments I did before were cleaning, pre-processing, analysing and so on. But all the dataset were given by professor. Therefore I hope I can learn ways to obtain data during this course.
