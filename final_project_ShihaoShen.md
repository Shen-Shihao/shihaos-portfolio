# Final Project Part I

## Outline
### Summary
* Smoking is an unhealthy habit which is harmful to everyone. Please quit/ask others quit smoking.
### Structure:
* State the percentage of men/women who somke daily/occasionally in the World. Indicates smoke is a common problem.
* Smoking leads to different diseases. e.g. Depression, heart attack, cancer.
* Chart of deaths from smoking & smoking death by age.
* Appeal readers keep away from smoking, and help family/friends quit smoking. Secondhand smoking is harmful as well.

## Data Source
* My data is a chart of deaths from smoking and smoking deaths by age. The source of the data comes from  https://ourworldindata.org/smoking in two charts, and I would like to combine them together. Because through the chart we can notice that deaths from smoking is increasing in the past few years, and there are millions of people who die in their golden ages.
* Deaths from smoking Link: https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/smoking-and-secondhand-deaths.csv
* Deaths by age Link: https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/smoking-deaths-by-age.csv

## Method and Medium
* I will use shorthand as the tool.
* As I mentioned in the structure, I will talk about the situation about smoking recently first. Then I will talk about the diseases which are caused by smoking. Finally, I will show a chart about deaths from smoking & deaths by age to appeal readers quit smoking and help others quit smoking.


# Final Project Part II

## Sketches
* https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/Sketches.pdf

## Storyboard
* https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/Storyboard.pdf

## User research
### Target audience
* Who smokes and those whose family/friend smokes.

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
* I invited 3 friends as representative individuals, and Student-A had already quit smoking last month. Student-B smokes daily, and Student-C had never smoked before. I invited them because they are in different situation, and they may have different opinions and feelings after seeing my sketches and storyboard. I asked them several questions list below as my interview script.

### Interview Script and feedback
1. Could you briefly talk about the storyboard's main idea?<br/>
A) Please quit smoking<br/>
B) Quit smoking<br/>
C) Stay away from cigarettes<br/>
2. What can you see from charts?<br/>
A) Smoking problem is more serious in northern hemisphere. More deaths in recent years.<br/>
B) Different situations in different areas. Deaths are increasing.<br/>
C) Smoking is a global problem. Deaths from age 15-49 decreased in 2016.<br/>
3. Is it good to add the optional part?<br/>
A) No.<br/>
B) No. You have only one minute.<br/>
C) No. It should be a serious topic.<br/>
4. Any modification on charts?<br/>
A) The map chart doesn't feel good. We cannot figure out the smoking ratio in a specific area in a country. For example, the smoking ratio my be high in Beijing but low in Shanghai, but they are covered by same color.<br/>
B) Divide deaths from age into three rectangles.<br/>
C) Add a number on the second chart.<br/>
5. Which is the most important part?<br/>
A) 4.<br/>
B) 4. Since people care about healthy, and death number is impressive.<br/>
C) 4.<br/>
6. Any recommendation?<br/>
A) Change map into bar chart.<br/>
B) No.<br/>
C) Do not list too much diseases there. Several images are more attractive.<br/>

### Findings from interviews
* The optional part is not that funning and should be delete.
* The names of diseases are boring, a image is more easy to get the point and attractive.
* The second chart is most important, but should be modified.
* The map should be modified. It seems that the whole country has same smoking ratio in all areas.

### Changes
* Divide the deaths from age bar into 3 bars in different ages, so that it is easier to read how many people die in what age.
* Change the diseases names into several attractive images, which saves time as well.
* Delete the optional part. 
* Although the map chart is kind of misleading, I will keep it in my wireframe.
