# Final Project Part I

## Outline
### Summary
* Smoking is an unhealthy habit which is harmful to everyone. Please quit/ask others quit smoking.
### Structure:
* State the percentage of men/women who somke daily/occasionally in the United States. Indicates smoke is a common problem in US.
* Smoking leads to different diseases. e.g. Depression, heart attack, cancer.
* Chart of deaths from smoking & smoking death by age.
* Appeal readers keep away from smoking, and help family/friends quit smoking. Secondhand smoking is harmful as well.

## Data Source
* My data is a chart of deaths from smoking and smoking deaths by age. The source of the data comes from  https://ourworldindata.org/smoking in two charts, and I would like to combine them together. Because through the chart we can notice that deaths from smoking is increasing in the past few years, and there are millions of people who die in their golden ages.
* Deaths from smoking Link: https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/smoking-and-secondhand-deaths.csv
* Deaths by age Link: https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/smoking-deaths-by-age.csv

## Method and Medium
* I will use shorthand as the tool.
* As I mentioned in the structure, I will talk about the situation about smoking recently first. Then I will talk about the diseases which are caused by smoking. Finally, I will show a chart about deaths from smoking & deaths by age to appeal readers quit smoking and help others quit smoking.


# Final Project Part II

## Sketches


## Storyboard


## User research
### Target audience
* Who smokes and those whose family/friend smokes.

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
* I invited 3 friends as representative individuals, and Student-A had already quit smoking last month. Student-B smokes daily, and Student-C had never smoked before. I invited them because they are in different situation, and they may have different opinions and feelings after seeing my sketches and storyboard. I asked them several questions list below as my interview script.
