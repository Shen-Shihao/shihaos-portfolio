# Final Project Part I

## Outline
### Summary
* Smoking is an unhealthy habit which is harmful to everyone. Please stay away from smoking.
### Structure:
* State the percentage of men/women who somke daily/occasionally in the World. Indicates smoke is a common problem.
* Smoking leads to different diseases. e.g. Depression, heart attack, cancer.
* Chart of deaths from smoking & smoking death by age.
* Appeal readers keep away from smoking, and help family/friends quit smoking. Secondhand smoking is harmful as well.

## Data Source
* My data is a chart of deaths from smoking and smoking deaths by age. The source of the data comes from  https://ourworldindata.org/smoking in two charts, and I would like to combine them together. Because through the chart we can notice that deaths from smoking is increasing in the past few years, and there are millions of people who die in their golden ages.
* Deaths from smoking Link: https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/smoking-and-secondhand-deaths.csv
* Deaths by age Link: https://github.com/SsJnton/shihaos-portfolio/blob/master/smoking-deaths-by-age.csv

## Method and Medium
* I will use shorthand as the tool.
* As I mentioned in the structure, I will talk about the situation about smoking recently first. Then I will talk about the diseases which are caused by smoking. Finally, I will show a chart about deaths from smoking & deaths by age to appeal readers quit smoking and help others quit smoking.

## Storyboard

## User research
### Target audience
* Who did not smoke and who has quit smoking.

### Approach to identifying representative individuals to interview
* I invited 3 friends as representative individuals, and Student-A had already quit smoking last month. Student-B smokes daily, and Student-C had never smoked before. I invited them because they are in different situation, and they may have different opinions and feelings after seeing my sketches and storyboard. I asked them several questions list below as my interview script.

### Interview Script and feedback
1. Could you briefly talk about the storyboard's main idea?<br/>
A) Please quit smoking<br/>
B) Quit smoking<br/>
C) Stay away from cigarettes<br/>
2. What can you see from charts?<br/>
A) Smoking problem is more serious in northern hemisphere. More deaths in recent years.<br/>
B) Different situations in different areas. Deaths are increasing.<br/>
C) Smoking is a global problem. Deaths from age 15-49 decreased in 2016.<br/>
3. Is it good to add the optional part?<br/>
A) No.<br/>
B) No. You have only one minute.<br/>
C) No. It should be a serious topic.<br/>
4. Any modification on charts?<br/>
A) The map chart doesn't feel good. We cannot figure out the smoking ratio in a specific area in a country. For example, the smoking ratio my be high in Beijing but low in Shanghai, but they are covered by same color.<br/>
B) Divide deaths from age into three rectangles.<br/>
C) Add a number on the second chart.<br/>
5. Which is the most important part?<br/>
A) 4.<br/>
B) 4. Since people care about healthy, and death number is impressive.<br/>
C) 4.<br/>
6. Any recommendation?<br/>
A) Change map into bar chart.<br/>
B) No.<br/>
C) Do not list too much diseases there. Several images are more attractive.<br/>

### Findings from interviews
* The optional part is not that funning and should be delete.
* The names of diseases are boring, a image is more easy to get the point and attractive.
* The second chart is most important, but should be modified.
* The map should be modified. It seems that the whole country has same smoking ratio in all areas.

### Changes
* Divide the deaths from age bar into 3 bars in different ages, so that it is easier to read how many people die in what age.
* Change the diseases names into several attractive images, which saves time as well.
* Delete the optional part. 
* Although the map chart is kind of misleading, I will keep it in my wireframe.

# Final Project Part III

## Intended audience
* My intended audience are those who doesn't smoke, and those who has already quit smoking.
* As we all know, smoking is not a good habit. Although it helps you to relax, to think calmly, it can also destroy your body at the same time. However, sharing cigarettes becomes a "etiquette" now. People invite their friends to smoke and explain the advantage of smoking and try to convience others to join them. 
* Therefore, I hope those people who doesn't smoke, or who has already quit smoking, stay away from smoking in the rest of your life. Smoking is not necessary for you, it will destroy your body, and empty your wallet.

## Work Summary
### Part I
* First, to be honest, I visited ourworldindata.org to check if there is any topic I am interested in, and fortunately, I found an attractive one. Because when I was a high school student, I thought smoking is a cool thing but luckly I didn't try. Now I know that smoking is not cool, but the rebellion in adolescene is pretty stupid. So I selected this topic and I hope I can convince those people who doesn't smoke but think smoking is cool or helpful to stay away from it.
* Second, I built the structure of my story. This is a important step since the logic to tell the story has been designed here. What to tell at first, what to tell then, and how to attract your audience according to moodboard need to be considerated here. Therefore, for my first version, I decided to tell the ratio of smoking people at first, and then health effects of smoking and deaths from smoking at last. I think this is a rational order because I show a marco picture of percentage of people around the world to indicates smoking is a serious problem, and then smoking can lead to many diseases, and finally the deaths from smoking in huge. 
* Finally, I downloaded the data from ourworldindata.org, and cleaned the data as pre-processing.

### Part II
* First, I drew sketches about the chart part, which is the most important part in this story. According to the data I cleaned before, I drew the chart by hand in paint. However, after finish Part II I noticed that I should built my chart in other tools such as Tableau or Inforgram, which is more beautiful and easy to read.
* Second, I drew a storyboard to show the order of "slides" in shorthand and make sure this is reasonable and brief. Since we only have one minute to tell our story, I wrote how many seconds I should spend on each "slide" in my storyboard, which is very helpful.
* Third, I did the interview. As I mentioned in Part II, I invited 3 friends to do the interview, and one of them has quit smoking, one does not smoke, and one smokes almost daily. It is very interesting during the interview that according to their different situation, their attitude and mood is different. Although they all admit smoking is harmful, the one who smokes seems numb during the interview. It seems that he has already know the disadvantages of smoking, and he is willing to take them. And I found that it is really hard to convince someone to quit smoking, which is almost impossible.
* Finally, I want to talk about the feedback for my Part II, which is also very important and helpful to my project. For my first map chart, I think it is necessary at first. However, according to the feedback, I noticed that the first chart is useless. Showing how many people smoke daily is not meaningful at all. There is not a really relationship between how many and how dangerous it is. Therefore, I decide to remove the first chart. Additionally, I also noticed that ask someone to quit smoking is almost impossible, even if they quit smoking finally, it is not because of my story. So I changed my topic to Stay Away From Smoking. To avoid something happen is much easier than to change something. And I also added a "slide" at last to indicates how many people quit smoking successfully. Because I think the hardness of quit smoking could be a rational reason to avoid starting smoking.
